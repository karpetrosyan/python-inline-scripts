## Commands

- python-inline-scripts.createPythonScript: If called via the UI, it creates a file containing inline metadata defined in [PEP 723](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/). If called directly through the command palette, it opens a separate window with the temporary directory, activates the virtual environment, and displays the script with inline metadata.
- python-inline-scripts.runPythonScript: Used by the UI to run the current Python file, expecting it to contain inline metadata defined in [PEP 723](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/).
